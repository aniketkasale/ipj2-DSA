# LinkedList

- LinkedList is a data structure that consists the series of nodes connected by pointers or references.

- Each node contains data and pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

- Think of storing a value in a LinkedList as storing a pair: [element, reference], where the element is the data and the reference points to the next node.
